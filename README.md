wiki_walker
===========

A website meant to ease wiki-walking.

##Features
###(or eventual features, I suppose)
* Renders wikipedia pages (exciting, I know)
* Tracks wikipedia pages already visited (this isn't the good part okay)
* Maintains a tree-structure of all pages visited so far (aha)
* Or, facilitates wiki-walking by helping you get back to where you were after branching off a lot.
* Long-term, will have a nice GUI to help you visualise the tree.  (raw HTML trees will be ugly)
